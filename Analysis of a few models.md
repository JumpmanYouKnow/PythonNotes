---------------------
### 1.  OLS
Ordinary Least Squares, the most common estimation method for linear models,
It's good and simple, however, it has lots of assumptions.
1. the regression model is linear in coefficients and the error term
2. random sampling of observations
3. No multi-collinearity (each variable  is independent)
4. Error term is independent and identically distributed
5. all independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term
### 1.  LASSO
