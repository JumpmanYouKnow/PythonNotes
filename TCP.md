How is a computer program executed? A program needs at least one **thread**, one **process**, one **core**, one **CPU** to run on, and a thread lives in process, a process lives in core, a core lives in a CPU.

## Concurrent and Parallel
Concurrent:
Parallel: Execution at the same time.
## What is a process

## What is a thread
